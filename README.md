# Memory Detector

This program can detect [Memory (concentration, pairs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) cards
from a video stream or test image and figure out their position on their playing grid. It is part of a group of
proof-of-concept programs for a group paper written by four students at Berlin School of Economics and Law. Our goal is
to make a [NAO Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nao_(robot)) play Memory against a human opponent.

Memory Detector can run on Windows, macOS and Linux, provided you have a Python version of at least 3.8 installed. The
YOLOv3 weights, which are required to run the image detection can't be found, you can download them from within the
program.
